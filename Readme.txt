Day 17-21: Data modelling project tbc; record count loss was noticed when ingesting the dataset into workbench and is solved by first converting it to csv using R and taking non-ASCII character into account. Initial plan is dividing dataset into four or five tables or database normalization but adjustment is needed after prelim exploring.
Day 22: Data modeling course project is completed but in an imperfect sense; much more data wrangling will be required (despite some simple transformation is already been done) in order to populate the data to the database built according to ideal data model structure. As it is not required by the project I will move on for now. Beside developing a entity relationship model and a star schema for the source and warehouse respectively, three graphs and a dashboard were built using tableau
